I was hunting for a way to easily hook up Vue.js in a static site generated by jekyll and hosted on github pages. I saw a number of ways that people had tried to achieve that end. A quick glance at the documentation showed me a much easier way than manually generating the json I want. I present a one line endpoint for the posts in your jekyll site:

{% raw %}

```markdown
---
---
{{ site.posts | jsonify }}

```

{% endraw %}
